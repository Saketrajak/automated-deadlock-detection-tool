## 📌 Overview
The **Automated Deadlock Detection Tool** is a C++ implementation that monitors resource allocation and detects deadlocks in an Operating System environment. It uses a **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)** to identify cycles and applies deadlock resolution strategies to prevent system crashes.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Real-time Deadlock Detection** using cycle detection in a resource allocation graph.
- **Deadlock Resolution** by preempting processes or releasing resources.
- **Logging System** to track deadlock occurrences.
- **Configurable Process & Resource Allocation** through JSON files.
- **Modular Codebase** for easy expansion.
